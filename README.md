(To my evaluators - Please note I first did this course several months ago without certification, and I'm now resubmitting on the Signature track. This is why the date on this repo is several months old)

This repo is to fulfil the requirements for module 3 of the Coursera data-science specialisation ('Gathering and Cleaning Data')

All manipulation and tranformations for this module are done with the script 'run_analysis.R'

The output is a text file called 'module3.txt' which is a tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

All data used is taken from the Coursera link: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Data is assumed to be in the project directory (i.e. the script's working directory)

See CodeBook.md for a description of the original data, the variables, and the transformations performed by the script
