This repo is to fulfil the requirements for module 3 of the Coursera data-science specialisation ('Gathering and Cleaning Data')

All manipulation and tranformations for this module are done with the script 'run_analysis.R'

The output is a text file called 'module3.txt' which is a tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

All data used is taken from the Coursera link: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Data is assumed to be in the project directory (i.e. the script's working directory)

See CodeBook.md for a description of the original data, the variables, and the transformations performed by the script
